// TestDatabaseIntegration documents that database functions are tested through integration tests.
// The database package contains functions that interact with PostgreSQL and are heavily
// dependent on database state. These are thoroughly tested through the handler integration
// tests which use testcontainers to spin up a real PostgreSQL instance.
//
// Functions tested include:
// - InitDB: Database connection pool initialization
// - VerifySchema: Schema migration and verification
// - All SQL queries in queries.sql.go (generated by sqlc)
// - Database operations for users, projects, LLM services, embeddings, and similar searches
//
// See internal/handlers/*_test.go for the integration tests that exercise these functions.

// Note: The queries.sql.go file is auto-generated by sqlc and contains the SQL query
// implementations. These are tested indirectly through all the handler integration tests
// which perform database operations. The models.go and db.go files are also generated
// by sqlc and define the database schema types.
