-- Generate go code with: sqlc generate

-- sqlc creates Go functions from the SQL commands below, using annotations
-- (beginning with "-- name:") to derive function names and result types.
-- In the end of the annotation, :one means single result, :many means multiple results, :exec means no results.

-- The conventions for function names used in this project are as follows:
-- - "Get" functions return lists of objects as identifiers or minimal metadata,
-- - "Retrieve" functions return single objects with full object data.
-- - "Upsert" functions insert or update objects and return only identifiers or minimal metadata.
-- - "Delete" functions delete objects and return no data.
-- - "Link..." and "Unlink..." functions create or remove associations between objects.
-- - "Is..." functions return boolean values.
-- - "Count..." functions return counts of objects.
-- - "...All..." functions return all objects of a type without filtering (or perform an action on all records).
-- - "...By..." functions return objects filtered by some association.
